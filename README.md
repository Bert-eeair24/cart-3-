📄 Description
Online Shopping Cart is a console-based Java application that simulates an online shopping experience. Users can add products to a cart, view cart contents, update product quantities, and remove products. The project showcases object-oriented programming principles and basic data handling through user input and structured output.

🎯 Objectives
Create a functional shopping cart using Java.

Implement object-oriented programming concepts (encapsulation, composition).

Enable dynamic management of products using data structures.

Provide a simple and user-friendly interface for interaction.

Validate and handle user input effectively.

📋 Project Requirement List (5 points)
Add products to the cart.

View the cart and list all products.

Display total price of items in the cart.

Update quantity of a selected product.

Remove a product from the cart.

Handle empty cart scenarios.

Provide a menu-driven user interface.

Prevent invalid inputs or actions.

Use of ArrayList for dynamic storage.

Utilize OOP concepts (Product, ShoppingCart classes).

📚 Documentation (10 points)
🔧 Key Classes & Methods:
Product – Represents a product with a name, price, and quantity.

ShoppingCart – Maintains a list of products and supports:

addItem(Product product)

viewCart()

updateItem(int index, int newQuantity)

removeItem(int index)

OnlineShoppingCart – The main class handling the menu and user interactions via Scanner.

🧠 Data Structures:
ArrayList<Product> is used to store and manage the products dynamically.

⚠️ Challenges Faced:
Adjusting 1-based user input to 0-based indexing in code.

Ensuring safe and consistent user input validation.

Keeping the interface clear and concise for non-technical users.
